# Gym-dumbbells-disorder-

## Project Overview
This project simulates the organization of a gym environment and demonstrates how messiness can ensue if even a minority of users are not following the rules, per example, to return the dumbbels on the right place accordingly to they respective weight. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to model the behavior of gym users and the state of the gym equipment.

- Tracks the state of dumbbells in the gym.
- Calculates the messiness of the gym based on misplaced equipment.
